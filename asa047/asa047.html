    <p>
      <b>ASA047</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      seeks to minimize a scalar function of several variables using the
      Nelder-Mead algorithm,
      by R ONeill.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ASA047</b> is Applied Statistics Algorithm 47.  Source code for many
      Applied Statistics Algorithms is available through
