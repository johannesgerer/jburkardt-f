      RING_MPI <br> Estimating Communication Rates in MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RING_MPI</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      estimates the time it takes to send a vector of N double precision values
      through each process in a ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Process 0 sends N double precision values to process 1, which passes them
      to process 2, and so on, until process P-1 sends them back to process 0.
      The time for this transmission is recorded.  The experiment is repeated 
      several times, and for several different array sizes N.
