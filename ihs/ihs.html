      IHS <br> Improved Distributed Hypercube Sampling
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IHS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      carries out the improved distributed hypercube sampling algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      N Points in an M dimensional Latin hypercube are to be selected.
      Each of the M coordinate dimensions is discretized to the values
      1 through N.  The points are to be chosen in such a way that
      no two points have any coordinate value in common.  This is
      a standard Latin hypercube requirement, and there are many
      solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm differs in that it tries to pick a solution
      which has the property that the points are "spread out"
      as evenly as possible.  It does this by determining an optimal
      even spacing, and using the duplication factor D to allow it
      to choose the best of the various options available to it
      (the more duplication, the better chance of optimization).
    </p>

    <p>
      One drawback to this algorithm is that it requires an internal
      real distance array of dimension D * N * N.  For a relatively moderate
      problem with N = 1000, this can exceed the easily accessible
      memory.  Moreover, the program is inherently quadratic
      in execution time as well as memory; the computation of the I-th
      point in the set of N requires a consideration of the value of
      the coordinates used up by the previous points, and the distances
      from each of those points to the candidates for the next point.
