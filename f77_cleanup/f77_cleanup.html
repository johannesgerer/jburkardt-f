      F77_CLEANUP <br> Minor Cleanups to a FORTRAN77 File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F77_CLEANUP</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes some minor cleanups to the text of a FORTRAN77 file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, in the revised program:
      <ul>
        <li>
          TAB characters are replaced by six spaces;
        </li>
        <li>
          all comments begin with a lowercase "c";
        </li>
        <li>
          all continuation characters are "&";
        </li>
        <li>
          all (noncomment) lines are no longer than 72 characters.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>f77_cleanup</b> <i>input.f77</i> <i>output.f77</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the file <i>file.f77</i> and creates a copy <i>output.f77</i>
          with cleanups.
        </dd>
      </dl>
