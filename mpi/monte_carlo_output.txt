 
MONTE_CARLO - Master process:
  Estimate PI by the Monte Carlo method.
 
  This program runs under MPI.
  The number of processes is      4
 
  Points in the unit square will be tested
  to see if they lie in the unit quarter circle.
 
  Process   0 is active.
 
  The method continues computing until:
  PI is computed to a tolerance of   0.100000E-02
  or the number of points used reaches   1000000
 
MONTE_CARLO - Master process:
  The random number server process ID is      3
 
  Process   1 is active.
 
  Process   2 is active.
 
  Process   3 is active.
 
MONTE_CARLO - Master process:
  Estimate for PI =    3.14076    
  Error =             0.837098E-03
  Number of points =  90000
 
MONTE_CARLO - Master process:
  Normal end of execution.
