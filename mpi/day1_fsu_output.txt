  The number of processes available is        0
 
P:0 - MPI has no work for me!
 
P:2 - MPI has no work for me!
P:1 sent 200 integers to process 3
P:1 received real values from process 3.
P:1 Number of real values received is   6
P:1 First 3 values =   0.4717  0.6792  0.9245
 
P:3 received integer values from process 1.
P:3 - Number of integers received is      200
P:3 First 3 values =        0       1       4
P:3 Input integer       25 becomes   0.4717
P:3 Input integer       36 becomes   0.6792
P:3 Input integer       49 becomes   0.9245
P:3 sent   6 reals to process 1
