 
INTERVALS - Master process:
  A FORTRAN90 program using MPI.
  A quadrature over an interval is done by
  assigning subintervals to processes.
  The number of processes is      4
 
Process      0: Active!
 
INTERVALS - Master process:
  Subintervals have been assigned.
 
INTERVALS - Master process:
 
Process      1: Active!
 
 
Process      2: Active!
  Estimate for PI is    3.14159    
  Error is             0.925926E-06
Process      3: Active!
 
  Elapsed wall clock seconds =       0.001556
 
INTERVALS - Master process:
  Normal end of execution.
