      OPENMP <br> FORTRAN90 Examples of Parallel Programming with OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPENMP</b> 
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 examples which
      illustrate the use of the OpenMP application program interface
      for carrying out parallel computations in a shared memory environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The directives
      allow the user to mark areas of the code, such as <b>do</b>,
      <b>while</b> or <b>for</b> loops, which are suitable for parallel
      processing.  The directives appear as a special kind of 
      comment, so the program can be compiled and run in serial mode.  
      However, the user can tell the compiler to "notice" the special
      directives, in which case a version of the program will be created 
      that runs in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the same program can easily be run in serial or parallel mode 
      on a given computer, or run on a computer that does not have 
      <b>OpenMP</b> at all. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> is suitable for a <i>shared memory</i> parallel system,
      that is, a situation in which there is a single memory space, and
      multiple processors.  If memory is shared, then typically the number
      of processors will be small, and they will all be on the same
      physical machine.  
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, in a <i>distributed memory</i> system, items of data
      are closely associated with a particular processor.  There may
      be a very large number of processors, and they may be more loosely
      coupled and even on different machines.  Such a system will need
      to be handled with <a href = "../mpi/mpi.html">MPI</a> or some
      other message passing interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> descended in part from the old Cray microtasking 
      directives, so if you've lived long enough to remember those, you 
      will recognize some features.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      FORTRAN90 Issues
    </h3>

    <p>
      OpenMP includes a number of functions whose type must be declared in
      any program that uses them.  To avoid having to declare these functions,
      you can use the command
      <pre><b>
        use omp_lib
      </b></pre>
      in any routine that invokes OpenMP functions.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      "Pretend" Parallelism
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> allows you to "request" any number of threads of execution.
      This is a request, and it's not always a wise request.  If your system has
      four processors available, and they're not busy doing other things, or serving
      other users, maybe 4 threads is what you want.  But you can't guarantee
      you'll get the undivided use of those processors.  Moreover, if you run the
      same program using 1 thread and 4 threads, you may find that using 4 threads
      <i>slows you down</i>, either because you don't actually have 4 processors,
      (so the system has the overhead of pretending to run in parallel), or because
      the processors you have are also busy doing other things.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, it's wise to run the program at least once in single thread mode,
      so you have a benchmark against which to measure the speedup you got (or didn't
      get!) versus the speedup you hoped for.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Compiler Support
    </h3>

    <p>
      The compiler you use must recognize the OpenMP directives in order to produce
      code that will run in parallel.  Here are some of the compilers available that
      support OpenMP:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The GNU compilers <b>gcc/g++</b> (version 4.2 or later) 
          and <b>gfortran</b> (version 2.0 or later).
        </li>
        <li>
          The IBM compilers <b>xlc</b> and <b>xlf</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Intel compilers <b>icc</b>, <b>icpc</b> and <b>ifort</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Portland Group C/C++ and Fortran compilers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sun Studio C/C++ and Fortran95 compilers.

      <b>DOT_PRODUCT</b> compares the computation of a vector dot product
      in sequential mode, and using OpenMP.  Typically, the overhead of using
      parallel processing outweighs the advantage for small vector sizes N.
      The code demonstrates this fact by using a number of values of N,
      and by running both sequential and OpenMP versions of the calculation.
