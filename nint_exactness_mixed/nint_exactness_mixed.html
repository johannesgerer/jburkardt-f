      NINT_EXACTNESS_MIXED <br> Exactness of Multidimensional Quadrature Using Mixed Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NINT_EXACTNESS_MIXED</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a multidimensional
      quadrature rule based on a direct product of one-dimensional rules.
      The one dimensional rules, in turn, may be any mixture of rules
      for 6 standard quadrature problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The six standard 1d quadrature problems that may be used as factors
      for the multidimensional problem are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Legendre integration</b><br>
          interval: [-1,+1],<br>
          weight: w(x) = 1,<br>
          rules: Clenshaw Curtis, Fejer Type 2, Gauss Legendre, Gauss Patterson.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jacobi integration</b>:<br>
          interval: [-1,+1],<br>
          weight: w(x) = (1-x)^alpha (1+x)^beta.<br>
          rules: Gauss Jacobi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Laguerre integration</b> <br>
          interval: [0,+oo),<br>
          weight: w(x) = exp(-x).<br>
          rules: Gauss Laguerre.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Generalized Laguerre integration</b><br>
          interval: [0,+oo),<br>
          weight: w(x) = x^alpha exp(-x).<br>
          rules: Gauss Laguerre.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hermite integration</b><br>
          interval: (-oo,+oo),<br>
          weight: w(x) = exp(-x*x).<br>
          rules: Gauss Hermite.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Generalized Hermite integration</b> <br>
          interval: (-oo,+oo),<br>
          weight: w(x) = |x|^alpha exp(-x*x).<br>
          rules: generalized Gauss Hermite.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The M-dimensional quadrature region R based on mixed factors is formed by the
      direct product
      <blockquote><b>
        R = R1 x R2 x ... x Rm
      </b></blockquote>
      where each factor region Ri is the region associated with one of the six
      rules.  Thus, R is a sort of generalized hyperrectangle, with the understanding
      that in some coordinate directions the region may be semi-infinite or
      infinite.
    </p>

    <p>
      The M-dimensional weight function W based on mixed factors is formed by the
      dproduct
      <blockquote><b>
        w(x1,x2,...xm) = w1(x1) x w2(x2) x ... x wm(xm)
      </b></blockquote>
      where each factor weight wi(xi) is the weight function associated with one of the six
      rules.  Some weight functions include parameters alpha and beta, and these
      parameters may be specified independently in each dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a quadrature region R based on mixed factors, the corresponding
      monomial integrand has the form
      <blockquote><b>
        Mono(X,E) = X1^E1 x X2^E2 x ... x Xm^Em
      </b></blockquote>
      where each exponent Ei is a nonnegative integer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The total degree of a monomial Mono(X,E) is:
      <blockquote><b>
        TotalDegree(Mono(X,E)) = Sum ( 1 <= I <= M ) E(I)
      </b></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, for instance, the total degree of
      <blockquote><b>
        x1<sup>2</sup> * x2 * x3<sup>5</sup>
      </b></blockquote>
      is 2+1+5=8.
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding monomial integral is:
      <blockquote><b>
        Integral ( X in R ) Mono(X,E) W(X) dX
      </b></blockquote>
      where each exponent Ei is a nonnegative integer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>monomial exactness</b> of a quadrature rule is the maximum number D
      such that, for every monomial of total degree D or less, the quadrature
      rule produces the exact value of the monomial integral.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>polynomial exactness</b> of a quadrature rule is the maximum number D
      such that, for every polynomial of total degree D or less, the quadrature
      rule produces the exact value of the polynomial integral.  The total degree
      of a polynomial is simply the maximum of the total degrees of the monomials
      that form the polynomial.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is given a quadrature rule based on mixed factors, and seeks
      to determine the polynomial exactness of the rule.  It does this simply
      by applying the quadrature rule to all the monomials of a total degree
      0 up to some limit specified by the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule
      is defined by five files, to be read at input, and the
      maximum degree is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>a.txt</b>, the "ALPHA" file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>b.txt</b>, the "BETA" file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>, the "REGION" file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>, the "WEIGHT" file;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>, the "ABSCISSA" file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i>
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all the files.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>nint_exactness_mixed</b> <i>prefix</i> <i>degree_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the alpha, beta, region, weight
          and abscissa information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum total monomial degree to check.  This should be
          a relatively small nonnegative number, particularly if the
          spatial dimension is high.  A value of 5 or 10 might be
          reasonable, but a value of 50 or 100 is probably never a
          good input!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
