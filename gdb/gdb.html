      GDB <br> Using the GNU Debugger <br> on a FORTRAN90 Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GDB</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      illustrate the use of GDB, the GNU debugger program, intended to help programmers
      find the location and nature of run time errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>GDB</b> works with programs written in C, C++, FORTRAN77,
      FORTRAN90, Java, and assembly language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most common case in which you'll use <b>GDB</b> occurs when
      a program you've written crashes, leaving a core file.  You may
      really have no idea where the error occurred, in which case you
      could waste much time inserting output statements, or tinkering
      with various routines that turn out not to contain the error.
      But <b>GDB</b> can help you find the error much more quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for <b>GDB</b> to do its best work, it needs a
      <i>symbol table</i>, which helps it translate the computer
      addresses of variables to the names you used when setting them up.
      This symbol table is created at compile time, usually with the
      <b>-g</b> compile option, as in one of the following:
      <pre>
        gcc -g myprog.c
        g++ -g myprog.C
        f77 -g myprog.f
        f90 -g myprog.f90
      </pre>
      If your program has several parts, you will really need to compile
      each part with the symbol table option, as in
      <pre>
        gcc -g part1.c part2.c part3.c
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
        gcc -c -g part2.c
        gcc -c -g part3.c
        gcc -g part1.c part2.o part3.o
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, your program that crashed probably was <i>not</i> compiled
      with the symbol table option, so the first step is to recompile the
      program, rerun it, and presumably, recrash it!   If you really had
      a nice crash, you will now have a <b>core</b> file in your directory,
      which <b>GDB</b> will also need to examine as it helps you.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your executable is called <b>a.out</b>, then if you simply type
      <pre>
        <b>gdb</b> a.out core
      </pre>
      then <b>GDB</b> will usually be able to report the line of your
      program on which the fatal error occurred.
      This assumes, of course, that the <b>core</b> file and original
      source code files are in the current directory and correspond
      to the executable program.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other cases, you may want to run your program from the beginning,
      with the option to pause execution at certain places, so that you
      can query the values of certain variables.  This entails an interactive
      session, which might begin like this:
      <pre>
        <b>gdb</b> a.out
        run
        <i>
          Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
          0x12000162c in test02 () at bounder.f90:119
          119    b(j) = j + 1
          Current language:  auto; currently fortran
        </i>
        </i>
        print i
        $ 1   1000000
        quit
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that your program generally expects command line arguments,
      so that a typical execution might be
      <pre>
         myprog arg1 arg2 arg3
      </pre>
      Then the only thing you have to do is include those same arguments
      on the <b>run</b> command line:
      <pre>
        <b>gdb</b> <i>myprog</i>
        run arg1 arg2 arg3
      </pre>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>gdb</b> <i>executable</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Loads your executable into <b>gdb</b>.  Type "run" to make
          your program execute.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>gdb</b> <i>executable</i> <b>core</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Loads your program into <b>gbd</b> along with the <b>core</b>
          file created when your program crashed.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <b>BOUNDER</b> is an example in which an array index exceeds the
      array bounds, generating a runtime error.  Files you may copy include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder.f90">bounder.f90</a>,
          the source code;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder.sh">bounder.sh</a>, commands that
          compile and run the source code;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder_output.txt">bounder_output.txt</a>,
          the output file.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>BOUNDER_GDB</b> shows the steps involved in using GDB to track
      down the problem in BOUNDER.  Note that GDB needs access to the executable
      program that failed.  Normally, the GDB is run interactively,
      and the commands in the input file are entered one at a time by the
      user.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder_gdb.sh">bounder_gdb.sh</a>,
          commands that run BOUNDER with the debugger, and then
          discard the executable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder_gdb_input.txt">bounder_gdb_input.txt</a>,
          input commands to GDB, normally typed interactively.
          We are most curious to see the value of J.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "bounder_gdb_output.txt">bounder_gdb_output.txt</a>,
          the output from GDB, which normally goes to your screen.
