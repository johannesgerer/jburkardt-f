      RANDOM_MPI <br> Random Numbers using MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RANDOM_MPI</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      demonstrates one way to generate the same sequence of random numbers
      for both sequential execution and parallel execution under MPI.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simpler approach to random numbers would simply let each processor
      choose a seed.  Or the master processor could choose distinct seeds.
      However, this is not ideal since it will not match the sequential program
      and it does not avoid the possibility that two of the random sequences
      will quickly overlap because of a bad choice of seed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that if we have 10 processors available under MPI, we do not
      want each processor to generate the same random number sequence.
      Instead, we want each of the processors to generate a part of the
      sequence, so that all the parts together make up the same set of values
      that a sequential program would have computed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assume we are using a linear congruential
      random number generator or "LCRG", which takes
      an integer input and returns a new integer output:
      <blockquote><b>
          U = ( A * V + B ) mod C
      </b></blockquote>
      We assume that we want the MPI program to produce
      the same sequence of random values as a sequential
      program would - but we want each processor to compute
      one part of that sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do this by computing a new LCRG which can compute
      every P'th entry of the original one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our LCRG works with integers, but it is easy to
      turn each integer into a real number between [0,1].
    </p>

    <p>
      The particular scheme for computing the parameters of the new LCRG
      is implemented in the <b>UNIFORM</b> library.
