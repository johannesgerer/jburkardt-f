PGMA_IO_PRB
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the PGMA_IO ASCII portable grayscale routines.
 
TEST01
  PGMA_EXAMPLE sets up sample PGM data.
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGM file.
 
  Wrote the header and data for "pgma_io_prb_01.ascii.pgm".
  Number of rows of data =         300
  Number of columns of data =      300
 
TEST02
  PGMA_READ reads an ASCII PGM file.
 
  PGMA_WRITE_TEST created some data.
 
  PGMA_READ_HEADER read the header.
 
  Number of rows of data =         300
  Number of columns of data =      300
  Maximum G value =                 79
 
  PGMA_READ_DATA read the data.
 
  Sample data:
 
   1     1      60
  34    34      73
  67    67      34
 100   100      45
 133   133      60
 167   167      20
 200   200      32
 233   233      46
 266   266       7
 300   300      19
 
  The data was accepted by PGMA_CHECK_DATA.
 
TEST03
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGM file.
 
  In this example, we make a sort of grayscale
  checkerboard.
 
  Wrote the header and data for "pgma_io_prb_03.ascii.pgm".
  Number of rows of data =         300
  Number of columns of data =      300
 
PGMA_IO_PRB
  Normal end of execution.
