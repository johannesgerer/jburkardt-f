      PARTIAL_DIGEST <br> Recursive Solutions of the Partial Digest Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PARTIAL_DIGEST</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      seeks solutions of the partial digest problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the partial digest problem, we assume that there are <b>N</b>
      objects arranged along a line.  We denote the position of object <b>I</b>
      by <b>X(I)</b>.  The positions of the objects are unknown.  Instead,
      we have a list of the distances between every distinct pair of objects.
      Note that the distances are not "tagged"; that is, if there is a 175
      on the list of distances, we don't know which two objects are separated
      by that distance.  In the partial digest problem, we start with the
      <b>(N*(N-1))/2</b> distances, and must come up with at least one
      linear arrangement of <b>N</b> objects that corresponds to the distances.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the algorithm used here, we begin by arbitrarily setting <b>X(1)</b>
      to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our second step, we find the largest entry in the distance table, and
      set <b>X(2)</b> to that value.
    </p>

    <p>
      On each recursive step thereafter, we find the largest unused distance,
      <b>D</b>, and note that this must represent the distance of the next
      object from either <b>X(1)</b> or <b>X(2)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting with the first possibility,
      we consider placing this next object at <b>X(K)=D</b>.  We now must
      search the distance table, and ensure that the distances
      <b>|X(1)-X(K)|</b>
      through <b>|X(K-1)-X(K)|</b> all show up.  If so, then our tentative placement
      of the object is "plausible", and we can proceed to the next step of recursion,
      seeking the location of <b>X(K+1)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second possibility to check on this recursive step is that we should
      set <b>X(K)=X(2)-D</b>, since this would also explain the occurrence of
      the distance <b>D</b>.  The analysis of this case is otherwise the same
      as for the first one.
    </p>

    <p>
      This recursion is guaranteed to "encounter" every solution.  (Of course,
      there might be no solutions whatever.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach has the advantage that recursion is relatively clean
      and neat to program.  Disadvantages include the fact that the amount
      of memory required to store partial results will grow explosively
      as the size of the problem increases.  Also, it is difficult to intervene
      or interrupt the recursive process.  For instance, the calling program
      never receives the computed solutions directly.  Instead, the recursive
      routine "realizes" that it has computed a solution, and can print it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      For these reasons, it would be worth developing an equivalent version
      of the routines that uses backtracking instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this program used <b>integers</b> for the distances.  While
      this is somewhat unnatural, it is convenient when programming, since
      we are searching the list of distances for values that we arrive at
      by subtraction, and the slightest roundoff would mean that the algorithm
      would fail.  An alternative would be to allow floating point distances,
      but to allow a very slight margin of error when looking for a distance
      in the table that is equal to a difference calculated between two positions.
