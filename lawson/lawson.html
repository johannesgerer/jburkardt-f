    <p>
      <b>LAWSON</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      solves least squares
      problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most common least squares problems considers an overdetermined
      M by N linear system A*X=B.  A least squares solution X is sought
      which has the property that, although it generally is not a solution
      of the system, it is the best approximation to a solution, in the
      sense that it minimizes the L2 norm of the residual R=A*X-B.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, a unique solution to the system A*X=B will exist,
      and in that case the least squares solution will coincide with
      what is ordinarily meant by a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      In underdetermined cases, where multiple solutions exist,
      the least squares solution is usually taken to be that solution X
      which has minimum L2 norm, that is, which minimizes ||X||.
