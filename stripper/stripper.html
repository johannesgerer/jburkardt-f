      STRIPPER <br> Interactive File Modification
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STRIPPER</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      carries out some simple modifications to a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      It even knows a little bit about
      special kinds of files, such as "FORTRAN", "C" or "C++" source codes.
      <b>STRIPPER</b> can delete control characters, capitalize all characters,
      extract the fifth word from every line, write out only columns 10
      through 50, copy only the lines with or without a particular string,
      and a few other tricks.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to use the program, run it and try the "H" (help) command
      first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historical note and rant: this program was first developed in order to
      deal with a flood of FORTRAN77 program files which had both
      TAB characters (stupid, stupid) and sequence numbers (too distasteful
      to mention any further).
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeding such data to the compiler was
      asking for trouble, particularly if, beforehand, you had made
      any editing changes that caused the continuation character
      (oh my, did I forget to mention <i>those</i> things?) to shift out
      of its position, or the sequence numbers to poke their noses into
      the text fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of these problems would be invisible to
      the programmer, because many editors conspired to hide or
      "process" TAB characters in an indefensibly deceptive way.
      (This <b>ALL</b> goes back to "C" and "int's" and other abbreviations
      and shortcuts that seem to serve the incompetent or lazy typist
      while scattering deadly traps for the innocent).
      ...Anyway, I got tired of replacing TAB's and stripping out
      sequence numbers, so I wrote a program called <b>strip</b>
      to do it for me.  It got renamed <b>stripper</b> because there
      was some UNIX utility that got to the <b>strip</b> name first.
