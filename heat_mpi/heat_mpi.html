      The continuous problem
    </h3>

    <p>
      This program solves
      <pre>
        dUdT - k * d2UdX2 = F(X,T)
      </pre>
      over the interval [A,B] with boundary conditions
      <pre>
        U(A,T) = UA(T),
        U(B,T) = UB(T),
      </pre>
      over the time interval [T0,T1] with initial conditions
      <pre>
        U(X,T0) = U0(X)
      </pre>
    </p>

      The finite difference discretization
    </h3>

    <p>
      To apply the finite difference method, we define a grid of
      points X(1) through X(N), and a grid of times T(1) through T(M).
      In the simplest case, both grids are evenly spaced.  We denote
      by U(I,J) the approximate solution at spatial point X(I) and
      time T(J).
    </p>

    <p>
      A second order finite difference can be used to approximate the
      second derivative in space, using the solution at three
      points equally separated in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      A forward Euler approximation to the first derivative in time
      is used, which relates the value of the solution to its value
      at a short interval in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, at the spatial point X(I) and time T(J), the discretized differential
      equation defines a relationship between U(I-1,J), U(I,J), U(I+1,J)
      and the "future" value U(I,J+1).  This relationship can be drawn
      symbolically as a four node stencil:
      <pre>
                     U(I,J+1)
                      |
                      |
        U(I-1,J)-----U(I,J)--------U(I+1,J)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we are given the value of the solution at the initial time,
      we can use the stencil, plus the boundary condition information,
      to advance the solution to the next time step.  Repeating this
      operation gives us an approximation to the solution at every
      point in the space-time grid.
    </p>

      Using MPI to compute the solution:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To solve the 1D heat equation using MPI, we use a form of domain
      decomposition.  Given P processors, we divided the interval [A,B]
      into P equal subintervals.  Each processor can set up the stencil
      equations that define the solution almost independently.  The exception
      is that every processor needs to receive a copy of the solution
      values determined for the nodes on its immediately left and right sides.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, each processor uses MPI to send its leftmost solution value to its
      left neighbor, and its rightmost solution value to its rightmost neighbor.
      Of course, each processor must then also receive the corresponding information
      that its neighbors send to it.  (However, the first and last processor
      only have one neighbor, and use boundary condition information to determine
      the behavior of the solution at the node which is not next to another
      processor's node.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The naive way of setting up the information exchange works, but can
      be inefficient, since each processor sends a message and then waits for
      confirmation of receipt, which can't happen until some processor has
      moved to the "receive" stage, which only happens because the first or
      last processor doesn't have to receive information on a given step.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is worth investigating how to improve the information exchange
      (an exercise for the reader!).  The odd processors could SEND while the
      even processors RECEIVE for instance, guaranteeing that messages would
      not have to wait in a buffer.
