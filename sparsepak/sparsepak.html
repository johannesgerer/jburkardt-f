     SPARSEPAK <br> (Obsolete) Waterloo Sparse Matrix Package
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSEPAK</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      solves large sparse systems of linear equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSEPAK</b> is an old version of the Waterloo Sparse Matrix Package.
      <b>SPARSEPAK</b> can carry out direct solution of large sparse linear
      systems.  Only positive definite matrices should be used with this
      program.  Three different storage methods, and five solution
      algorithms are supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      The methods available are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1WD</b>: One way dissection, partitioned tree storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ND</b>: Nested dissection, compressed storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>QMD</b>: Quotient minimum degree, compressed storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RCM</b>: Reverse Cuthill-McKee with envelope storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RQT</b>: Refined quotient tree, partitioned tree storage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This version is not the most recent one.  The most recent version
      requires a license from the University of Waterloo, and includes
      support for large sparse linear least squares problems and other features.
    </p>

    <p>
      SPARSPAK offers five different methods for the direct solution of
      a symmetric positive definite sparse linear system.  Subroutines are
      provided which try to reorder the matrix before factorization so that
      as little storage as possible is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The five algorithms all follow the same steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Determine the structure of the matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reorder rows and columns for efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store numerical values in matrix and right hand side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Factor the matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Solve the system (may be repeated for multiple right hand sides).
        </li>
        <li>
          Unpermute the solution.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Each step requires calls to one or more subroutines in the group
      associated with a particular method.
    </p>

      Data Structures
    </h2>

    <p>
      The following is a list of the vectors required for the various methods,
      including their type, size, and whether they are set by the user or not.
      Unfortunately, for most of the arrays, although their values are
      determined by the package, their minimum size is not known beforehand,
      and is often hard to estimate.  You must examine the reference to get
      a better idea of how large to dimension arrays like XBLK and NZSUB,
      for example.

    <h2>
      Adjacency Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      You are responsible for defining the adjacency or nonzero structure of the
      original matrix.  This information is required by the routines to
      efficiently reorder the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose our linear system is a 6 by 6 matrix, where the entries
      marked 'X' are nonzero:
      <pre>
        XX000X
        XXXX00
        0XX0X0
        0X0X00
        00X0XX
        X000XX
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The adjacency information records, for each row I,  which columns
      (besides column I) contain a nonzero entry, and, for each column I,
      which rows besides row I are nonzero.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example, the nonzero list for row I=1 is 2 and 6.  This is because
      A(1,2) and A(1,6) are nonzero.  The whole list is
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Row</th><th>Nonzero columns</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>2, 6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>1, 3, 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td><td>2, 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td><td>3, 6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td><td>1, 5</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      Note that in the list of nonzeroes for row I, we never include I
      itself.  It is assumed that I is nonzero, or will become so during
      the factorization.
    </p>

    <p>
      The adjacency information consists of two vectors, IADJ and XADJ.  The
      vector IADJ contains the concatenated list of nonzeroes.  The auxilliary
      vector XADJ holds the location of the start of each row list in IADJ.
      Thus, XADJ(1) should  always be 1.  XADJ(2) should be the location in
      IADJ where the nonzero information for row 2 begins.  Finally, XADJ(N+1)
      points to the first unused entry in IADJ.  For the example,
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Index</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td>
          <td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>IADJ</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
          <td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>XADJ</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>11</td>
          <td>13</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can see that to retrieve information about row 3, you would first
      check XADJ(3) and XADJ(3+1), which have the values 6 and 8.  This tells
      us that the list for row 3 begins at IADJ(6) and stops at IADJ(8-1).
      So the nonzeroes in row 3 occur in columns IADJ(6)=2 and IADJ(7)=5.
      This seems a lot of work, but this construction can be automated, and
      the storage savings can be enormous.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Envelope Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      Assume, as usual, that we are working with a symmetric matrix.  The
      lower row bandwidth of row I, denoted by BETA(I), is defined in the
      obvious way to mean the distance between the diagonal entry in column I
      and the first nonzero entry in row I.
    </p>

    <p>
      The envelope of a matrix is then the collection of all subdiagonal
      matrix positions (I,J) which lie within the lower row bandwidth of
      their given row.  This concept is sometimes also called profile
      or skyline storage, particularly when columns are considered rather
      than rows.
    </p>

    <p>
      To store a matrix in envelope format, we require two objects,
      an array ENV to hold the actual numbers, and a pointer array
      XENV to tell us where each row starts and ends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us return to our earlier example:
      <pre>
        XX000X
        XXXX00
        0XX0X0
        0X0X00
        00X0XX
        X000XX
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can analyze this matrix as follows:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Row</th><th>Bandwidth</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td><td>5</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      This tells us that there are a total of 11 entries in the lower envelope.
      XENV(I) tells us where the first entry of row I is stored, and XENV(I+1)-1
      tells us where the last one is.  For our example, then
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Index</th><th>XENV</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td><td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td><td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7</td><td>12</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the "extra" entry in XENV allows us to treat the last row in
      the same way as the other ones.  Now the ENV array will require 11
      entries, and they can be stored and accessed using the XENV array.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Setting Matrix Values
    </h2>

    <p>
      Once you have defined the adjacency structure, you have set up empty slots
      for your matrix.  Into each position which you have set up, you can
      store a numerical value A(I,J).  You can use the user utility routines
      ADDRCM, ADDRQT and ADDCOM to store values in A for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively,  if you want to do this on your own, you must be
      familiar with the storage method used.  For example, in the envelope
      storage scheme you must know, given I and J, in what entry of DIAG and
      ENV you should store the value.  Interested readers are referred to
      the reference for more information on this.
