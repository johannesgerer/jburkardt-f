    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_DESIGN_RULE</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      implements a number of Hardin and Sloane "spherical designs", which
      can be used for numerical quadrature.
    </p>

    <p>
      A set of <b>N</b> points on the surface of a 3D sphere is called a 
      <i>spherical T-design</i> if the integral of any polynomial <b>p(x,y,z)</b>
      of degree at most <b>T</b> over the surface of the sphere is equal to 
      the average value of the polynomial evaluated at the set of points.
    </p>

    <p>  
      Note that the degree of a polynomial in several variables is the 
      highest degree of any of its terms, and that the degree of a term like 
      <b>X<sup>A</sup>Y<sup>B</sup>Z<sup>C</sup></b> is <b>A+B+C</b>.
