      BLAS1 <br>
      The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms <br>
      Level 1
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BLAS1</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      implements the Level 1 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>BLAS</b> are a small core library of linear algebra utilities,
      which can be highly optimized for various architectures.  Software
      that relies on the <b>BLAS</b> is thus highly portable, and will typically
      run very efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 1 BLAS are primarily for use in vector operations, such
      as vector norms, dot products, vector scaling, and the addition of a 
      scalar multiple of one vector to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the entries of a typical vector are stored continguously in memory,
      many BLAS1 routines allow the user to specify a vector by locating
      its first element, and giving an increment to be used to locate the
      successive elements.  An increment of +1 corresponds to the typical vector;
      however, by specifying other increments, a "logical" vector can be
      selected that is actually a row, column, or even a diagonal of a two-dimensional
      array.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 1 BLAS are available in both real and complex arithmetic
      versions, and using single precision or double precision.  In most
      cases, a given BLAS function has a root name, such as <b>AXPY</b>,
      and prefix is used to identify the arithmetic and precision.  Thus,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>CAXPY</b> is the single precision complex version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DAXPY</b> is the double precision real version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SAXPY</b> is the single precision real version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ZAXPY</b> is the double precision complex version of AXPY;
        </li>
      </ul>
