      SIMPLEX_COORDINATES <br> Coordinates of Regular Simplex in M Dimensions
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>SIMPLEX_COORDINATES</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      computes the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a regular
      simplex in M dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a straightforward but tedious method for computing these
      coordinates, coded in SIMPLEX_COORDINATES1, based on the idea of
      selecting the first coordinate to be (1,0,0,...0), and noting
      that the dot product with vectors 2 through N+1 must be -1/N,
      which means the first row and first column of the coordinate matrix
      are done.  We can then move to entry (2,2), assume the coordinates
      below it are 0, and set its value by requiring that the sum of the
      squares of the (2,1) and (2,2) entries must be 1. Setting the (2,2)
      entry then allows us to determine the rest of row 2 by the same
      dot product criterion, and we proceed in this way til we have
      completed the matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simpler algorithm, in SIMPLEX_COORDINATES2, notes that the identity
      matrix will almost work for the first N vertices.  Choose the last
      vertex by assuming all its entries are equal to some constant A, and 
      that its distance from any other vertex must be sqrt ( 2 ).  This 
      determines that (A-1)^2 + (N-1)*A^2 = 2, from which we get the value of
      A as (1-sqrt(N+1))/N.  To clean things up, we compute the centroid C
      of these vertices, and recenter the simplex around the origin.
      Then we determine the distance S of one vertex to the origin, and
      rescale so that this becomes 1.  The coding is simpler, and there
      is much less chance for the accumulation of numerical error.  Plus
      I thought of this one myself.
