      QR_SOLVE <br> Least Squares Solution of a Linear System A*x=b
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QR_SOLVE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      computes a least squares solution of a linear system of the form A*x=b.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many possible cases that can arise with the matrix A.
      Formally, we distinguish the cases M < N, M = N, and M > N, and
      we expect trouble whenever M is not equal to N.  Trouble may also
      arise when M = N but the matrix is singular.  Even if the matrix is,
      mathematically speaking, non-singular, it may be so close to singularity
      that an accurate solution is difficult to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      When M > N, we are placing more conditions than we have degrees of freedom,
      so we suppose that such a linear system cannot be solved.  However, it is
      possible that the extra conditions are illusory, being constructed from
      linear combinations of a fundamental set of N conditions.  Thus, a system
      that we typically call "overdetermined" can have a solution in the ordinary
      sense, that satisfies all the conditions, as long as the right hand side is
      "consistent".  Another way of saying this is that the system is solvable
      if the right hand side lies in the column space of A...although that simply
      says that it is a linear combination of the columns of A, which just says
      A*x=b.
    </p>

    <p>
      If A does not have full column rank, however, then even if the right hand
      side lies in the column space of A, there will be more than one linear 
      combination of columns that produce b.  Thus, the equations are consistent,
      the system is solvable, but not uniquely so.
    </p>

    <p>
      If M < N, then we are placing fewer conditions than we have degrees of
      freedom.  As long as the right hand side lies in the column space of A,
      we can guarantee that there will be multiple solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the question of a "solution" to the problem A*x=b is complicated
      enough that it seems to defy a common algorithmic approach.  Nonetheless,
      there are some sensible, robust procedures for producing an answer that
      corresponds to the classical solution, or solves the overdetermined problem
      when the right hand side is consistent.  This is the linear least squares
      solution, which finds a vector x which minimizes the Euclidean norm of
      the residual: ||r|| = ||A*x-b||.  This solution is produced by computing
      the QR factorization of the matrix A
    </p>

    <p>
      When there are multiple solutions to the problem, the QR approach used here
      produces a solution.  A more satisfactory approach, using the pseudoinverse,
      will produce a solution x which satisfies the additional constraint that
      it has the minimum norm of the entire family of solutions.  That pseudoinverse
      approach is not implemented in this library.  The singular value decomposition (SVD)
      can also produce this minimal solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For comparison, a solver that applies the normal equations is included.
      This approach requires M >= N, and that A have full column rank.  It constructs
      and solves the NxN system A'*A*x=A'*b.  This system has a condition number that
      is the square of the original system, so it also suffers from a significant
      loss in accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also include an SVD solver, which uses the pseudoinverse approach.
      First compute A = U * S * V', where U and V are orthogonal, and S is
      MxN diagonal, then to solve A*x=b write x = V * S^ * U' * b, where
      S^ is the matrix formed by transposing S and then replacing each nonzero
      diagonal element s by 1/s.  (However, very small elements should probably
      be zeroed instead of inverted.)  This procedure will also produce a vector
      x which minimizes the Euclidean norm.  However, it has one feature that the
      QR solver does not: in cases where the solution x is not unique (because
      A does not have full column rank) the SVD solver returns the unique vector
      x of minimum Euclidean norm.
