      F90_CALLS_MATLAB <br> FORTRAN90 Programs Interacting with MATLAB
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F90_CALLS_MATLAB</b>
      is a directory of FORTRAN90 programs which
      demonstrate how a FORTRAN90 program
      can interact with MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these examples, the interaction is done through the SYSTEM
      command, which allows a FORTRAN90 program to issue a command to
      the operating system, and to receive a result flag indicating the
      successful completion or failure of that command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SYSTEM command is not a standard or intrinsic routine
      defined by the FORTRAN standard.  However, it is often available
      to FORTRAN programmers on UNIX systems.  In particular, the GNU G95
      and IBM XLF compilers include this routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data can be passed between MATLAB and FORTRAN using text files.

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX_MULTIPLY</b> shows how a FORTRAN90 program can cooperate
      with MATLAB.  The FORTRAN90 program generates two matrices A and B,
      writes them to files, and invokes MATLAB with a particular M-file.
      The M-file reads the matrices from the files, computes the product C
      and writes it to a file.  The FORTRAN90 program resumes execution,
      reading the C file and reporting the result.
