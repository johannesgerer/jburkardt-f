      SATISFY_OPENMP <br> Seek Binary Circuit Inputs that Output 1, Using OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SATISFY_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      demonstrates, for a particular circuit, an exhaustive search
      for solutions of the circuit satisfy problem,
      using OpenMP for parallel execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem assumes that we are given a logical circuit of AND, OR and NOT
      gates, with N=23 binary inputs and a single output.  We are to determine all
      inputs which produce a 1 as the output.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general problem is NP complete, so there is no known polynomial-time
      algorithm to solve the general case.  The natural way to search for solutions
      then is exhaustive search of all 2^N possible inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an interesting way, this is a very extreme and discrete version of
      the problem of maximizing a scalar function of multiple variables.
      The difference is that here we know that both the input and output
      only have the values 0 and 1, rather than a continuous range of real
      values!
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem is a natural candidate for parallel computation, since
      the individual evaluations of the circuit are completely independent.
    </p>

    <p>
      On an Apple PowerPC G5 with two processors, the following results were
      observed:
