      TABLE_VORONOI <br> Voronoi Diagram Data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_VORONOI</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads in a dataset
      describing a 2D pointset, and prints out information defining
      the Voronoi diagram of the pointset.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_VORONOI</b> is based on the
      <a href = "../../f_src/geompack/geompack.html">GEOMPACK</a> library of
      Barry Joe, which computes the Delaunay triangulation.  The
      main work that <b>TABLE_VORONOI</b> does is to analyze that
      Delaunay information and work out the location of the Voronoi
      vertices, and their specific arrangement around each of the
      original data nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_VORONOI</b> is a work in progress; the output is
      currently simply printed, which is not very useful except for
      toy problems; printed output is of very little use for big problems.
      To handle big, interesting problems, I have to think about how
      to store this information in a useful and accessible data structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, I haven't thought enough about how to deal with the
      inevitable "infinite" Voronoi cells.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program begins with the pointset, of which a typical element
      is a point <b>G</b>.  Each <b>G</b> generates a Voronoi polygon (or
      semi-infinite region, which we will persist in calling a polygon).
      A typical vertex of the polygon is called <b>V</b>.    For the semi-infinite
      regions, we have a vertex at infinity, but it's really not helpful to
      store a vertex (Inf,Inf), since we have lost information about the
      direction from which we reach that infinite vertex.  We will have to
      treat these special regions with a little extra care.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are interested in computing the following quantities:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>G_DEGREE</b>, for generator <b>G</b>, the degree (number of
          vertices) of the Voronoi polygon;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>G_START</b>, for generator <b>G</b>, the index of the first
          Voronoi vertex in a traversal of the sides of the Voronoi polygon;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>G_FACE</b>, for all generators <b>G</b>, the sequence of Voronoi
          vertices in a traversal of the sides of the Voronoi polygon.
          A traversal of a semi-infinite polygon begins at an "infinite"
          vertex, lists the finite vertices, and then ends with a
          (different) infinite vertex.  Infinite vertices are given
          negative indexes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>V_NUM</b>, the number of (finite) Voronoi vertices <b>V</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>V_XY</b>, for each finite Voronoi vertex <b>V</b>,
          the XY coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I_NUM</b>, the number of Voronoi vertices at infinity;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I_XY</b>, the "direction" associated with each Voronoi vertex
          at infinity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      So if we have to draw a semi-infinite region, we start at infinity.
      We then need to draw a line from infinity to vertex #2.  We do so
      by drawing a line in the appropriate direction, stored in I_XY.
      Having safely reached finite vertex #2, we can connect the finite
      vertices, until it is time to draw another line to infinity, this
      time in another direction, also stored in I_XY.
