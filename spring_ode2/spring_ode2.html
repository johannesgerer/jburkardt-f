      SPRING_ODE2 <br> Gnuplot Graphics to Display Spring ODE Solution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPRING_ODE2</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      shows how Gnuplot graphics can be used to illustrate a solution of 
      the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes the motion 
      of a weight attached to a spring.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is a revision of the SPRING_ODE program.  A second
      change that we make is that we use vectors to store the
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hooke's law for a spring observes that the restoring force is
      proportional to the displacement: 
      <pre>
        F = - k x
      </pre>
      and Newton's law relates the force to acceleration:
      <pre>
        F = m a
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting these equations together, we have:
      <pre>
        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can add a damping force with coefficient c:
      <pre>
        m * d^2 x/dt^2 = - k * x - c * dx/dt
      </pre>
      If we write this as a pair of first order equations for (x,v), we have
      <pre>
            dx/dt = v
        m * dv/dt = - k * x - c * v
      </pre>
      and now we can approximate these values for small time steps.
