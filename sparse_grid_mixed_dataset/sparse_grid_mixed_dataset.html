    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_DATASET</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      creates a sparse grid dataset from a mixture of 1D rules, using
      instructions from a user.
    </p>

    <p>
      The available 1D quadrature rules are identified by a 2 or 3 letter code,
      and include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>CC</b>, Clenshaw-Curtis:<br>
           defined on [-1,+1], with w(x)=1,<br>
           a closed, fully nested rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>F2</b>, Fejer Type 2: <br>
          defined on (-1,+1), with w(x)=1,<br>

          <b>GLG</b>, Generalized Gauss Laguerre: <br>
          defined on (0,+oo) with w(x)=x^alpha * exp(-x),<br>
          an open, non-nested rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GJ</b>, Gauss Jacobi: <br>
          defined on [-1,+1] with w(x)=(1-x)^alpha (1+x)^beta<br>

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GW</b>, Golub Welsch: <br>
          a rule defined by the user based on the Golub-Welsch algorithm,<br>
          with points and weights supplied by external routines,<br>

          <i>(not supported yet)</i>
        </li>

          <b>CCS</b>, Clenshaw-Curtis Slow-Growth:<br>

          an open, fully nested rule.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user first specifies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b> the spatial dimension of the quadrature region,
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>L</b> the level that defines the Smolyak grid.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and these two values can actuallyb be specified on the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the user specifies rules for each of the M dimensions.
      A rule, when specified, may be used for one, or for multiple consecutive
      dimensions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          RULE identifies the 1D rule, and must be one of
          "CC", "F2", "GP", "GL", "GH", "GGH", "LG", "GLG", "GJ", "GW",
          "CCS", "F2S", "GPS".
        </li>
        <li>
          the number of times the rule is to be used for consecutive dimensions;
        </li>
        <li>
          ALPHA, a rule parameter, if needed.  (Rules GGH, GLG and GJ);
        </li>
        <li>
          BETA, a rule parameter, if needed.  (Rule GJ only).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the user specifies a "file identifier", that is, the main part
      of a string to be used when creating the files.
