      FILE_ROW_REVERSE <br> Reversed Copy of a File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FILE_ROW_REVERSE</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes a reversed copy of a text file.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, the file
      <pre>
        I got up,
        I ate breakfast,
        Then I went to work.
      </pre>
      would become
      <pre>
        Then I went to work.
        I ate breakfast,
        I got up.
      </pre>
    </p>
