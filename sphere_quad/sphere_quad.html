      SPHERE_QUAD <br> Quadrature on the Surface of the Unit Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_QUAD</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 library which 
      estimates the integral of a scalar function F(X,Y,Z) over the surface of 
      the unit sphere centered at the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes one function, <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_MC</b>, which
      estimates the integral using a Monte Carlo approach.  It randomly
      samples points on the surface, and estimates the integral as the
      average of these values times the area of the surface. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes three functions based on the idea of a
      latitudinal/longitudinal grid: <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_LLC</b>, 
      <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_LLV</b> and <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_LLM</b>.
      The surface of the sphere is divided into rectangles whose sides 
      are always lines of latitude or longitude.  Each rectangle is then
      split diagonally into a pair of triangles (except for the degenerate
      rectangles that include the north or south pole as a vertex.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The user controls the accuracy of the integral estimate by specifying
      a maximum side length H.  The functions determine angular increments 
      that guarantee the size restriction.  Of course, this means that the 
      restriction on latitude, enforced at the equator, will result in excessively
      small triangles away from the equator.  That is a penalty of
      using this simple subdivision scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes three functions based on the idea of first
      subdividing the surface into 20 congruent spherical triangles, based
      on the projection of a regular icosahedron.  The functions
      <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_ICOS1C</b>, <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_ICOS1V</b> and 
      <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_ICOS1M</b> use this idea, along with subdivision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_ICOS2V</b> is similar to 
      <b>SPHERE01_QUAD_ICOS1V</b> but uses a more sophisticated algorithm
      to project points from the planar triangle to the unit sphere.
      However, the modifications seem to make little difference to the
      resulting integral estimate.
