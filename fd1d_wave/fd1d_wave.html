      FD1D_WAVE <br> 
      Finite Difference Method<br> 
      1D Wave Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_WAVE</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies the finite difference method to solve
      a version of the wave equation in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program solves the 1D wave equation of the form:
      <pre>
        Utt = c^2 Uxx
      </pre>
      over the spatial interval [X1,X2] and time interval [T1,T2],
      with initial conditions:
      <pre>
        U(T1,X)  = U_T1(X),
        Ut(T1,X) = UT_T1(X),
      </pre>
      and boundary conditions of Dirichlet type:
      <pre>
        U(T,X1) = U_X1(T),<br>
        U(T,X2) = U_X2(T).
      </pre>
      The value <b>C</b> represents the propagation speed of waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses the finite difference method, and marches
      forward in time, solving for all the values of U at the next
      time step by using the values known at the previous two time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Central differences may be used to approximate both the time
      and space derivatives in the original differential equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, assuming we have available the approximated values of U
      at the current and previous times, we may write a discretized
      version of the wave equation as follows:
      <pre>
        Uxx(T,X) = ( U(T,   X+dX) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T,   X-dX) ) / dX^2
        Utt(T,X) = ( U(T+dt,X   ) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T-dt,X   ) ) / dT^2
      </pre>
      If we multiply the first term by C^2 and solve for the single
      unknown value U(T+dt,X), we have:
      <pre>
        U(T+dT,X) =        (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
                    +  2 * ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
                    +      (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
                    -                                  U(T-dT,X   )
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT, except for FIRST step!)
    </p>

    <p>
      However, on the very first step, we only have the values of U
      for the initial time, but not for the previous time step.
      In that case, we use the initial condition information for dUdT
      which can be approximated by a central difference that involves
      U(T+dT,X) and U(T-dT,X):
      <pre>
        dU/dT(T,X) = ( U(T+dT,X) - U(T-dT,X) ) / ( 2 * dT )
      </pre>
      and so we can estimate U(T-dT,X) as
      <pre>
        U(T-dT,X) = U(T+dT,X) - 2 * dT * dU/dT(T,X)
      </pre>
      If we replace the "missing" value of U(T-dT,X) by the known values
      on the right hand side, we now have U(T+dT,X) on both sides of the
      equation, so we have to rearrange to get the formula we use
      for just the first time step:
      <pre>
        U(T+dT,X) =   1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
                    +       ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
                    + 1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
                    +  dT *                         dU/dT(T,   X   )
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT for FIRST step.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear now that the quantity ALPHA = C * DT / DX will affect
      the stability of the calculation.  If it is greater than 1, then
      the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 is negative, and the
      sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients becomes unbounded.
