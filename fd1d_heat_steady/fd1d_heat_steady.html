      FD1D_HEAT_STEADY <br> Finite Difference Solution of a 1D Steady State Heat Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_HEAT_STEADY</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      applies the finite difference method to estimate the solution of
      the steady state heat equation over a one dimensional region, which
      can be thought of as a thin metal rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will assume the rod extends over the range A &lt;= X &lt;= B.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quantity of interest is the temperature U(X) at each point in the rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will assume that the temperature of the rod is fixed at known values
      at the two endpoints.  Symbolically, we write the <i>boundary conditions</i>:
      <pre>
        U(A) = UA
        U(B) = UB
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the rod, we assume that a version of the steady (time independent)
      heat equation applies.  This assumes that the situation in the rod has
      "settled down", so that the temperature configuration has no further
      tendency to change.  The equation we will consider is
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( K(X) * d/dx U(X) ) = F(X)
      </pre>
      Here, the right hand side term F(X) allows us to consider internal
      heat sources in the metal - perhaps a portion of the rod is sitting
      above a blow torch.  The coefficient K(X) is a measure of heat conductivity.
      It measures the rate at which the heat from a local hot spot will spread out.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the heat source function F(X) is zero everywhere, and if K(X) is
      constant, then the solution U(X) will be the straight line function
      that matches the two endpoint values.  Making F(X) positive over a small
      interval will "heat up" that portion.  You can simulate a rod that is
      divided into regions of different materials by setting the function K(X)
      to have a given value K1 over some subinteral of [A,B] and value K2 over
      the rest of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      To estimate the value of the solution, we will pick a uniform mesh
      of N points X(1) through X(N), from A to B.  At the I-th point, we will
      compute an estimated temperature U(I).  To do this, we will need to
      use the boundary conditions and the differential equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since X(1) = A and X(N) = B, we can use the boundary conditions to
      set U(1) = UA and U(N) = UB.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the points in the interior, we need to approximate the differential
      equation in a way that allows us to determine the solution values.
      We will do this using a finite difference approximation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose we are working at node X(I), which is associated with U(I).
      Then a centered difference approximation to
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( K(X) * d/dx U(X) )
      </pre>
      is
      <pre>
       - ( + K(X(I)+DX/2) * ( U(X(I+1)) - U(X(I))   ) / DX )
           - K(X(I)-DX/2) * ( U(X(I))   - U(X(I-1)) ) / DX ) / DX
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we rearrange the terms in this approximation, and set it equal to F(X(I)),
      we get the finite difference approximation to the differential equation at X(I):
      <pre>
            - K(X(I)-DX/2)                   * U(X(I-1)
        + (   K(X(I)-DX/2) + K(X(I)+DX(2)) ) * U(X(I))
                           - K(X(I)+DX(2))   * U(X(I+1)) = DX * DX * F(X(I))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that we have N-2 equations, each of which involves
      an unknown U(I) and its left and right neighbors, plus the two boundary
      conditions, which give us a total of N equations in N unknowns.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can set up and solve these linear equations using a matrix A for
      the coefficients, and a vector RHS for the right hand side terms,
      and calling a function to solve the system A*U=RHS will give us the solutioni.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because finite differences are only an approximation to derivatives, this
      process only produces estimates of the solution.  Usually, we can reduce
      this error by decreasing DX.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program assumes that the user will provide a calling program, and
      functions to evaluate K(X) and F(X).
