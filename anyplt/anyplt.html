      ANYPLT <br> Simple Graphics Interface
    </H1>

    <hr>

    <P>
      <b>ANYPLT</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      provides an interface between a FORTRAN90 program and
      a variety of graphics packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is outdated now, but at the time, I was trying to make
      it possible to define a simple graphic interface routine that
      would allow me to run the same program on a variety of machines
      and environments without having to worry about the details of
      the particular graphics package that was available.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interface consisted of a single subroutine, with a single
      argument, whose value indicated the graphics action desired.
      Any data required to carry out the indicated command was supplied
      indirectly, by setting certain variables in a COMMON block.
    </p>

    <p>
      This idea was helpful for me for a time.  Once I stopped needing
      to do graphics in so many environments, I quit developing the
      package, and it has started to suffer 'data rot'.  Nonetheless,
      I keep it around in fond memory of the time when it was so helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
      At one time or another, I had developed the following interfaces:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ANYATT</b>, a version which uses the high resolution mode of the AT&T
          PC6300.  (400 pixels high, 640 wide).  Characters and symbols
          are drawn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYBUG</b>, merely a debugging tool, this package records all the calls
          to ANYPLT in a file.  (Nominally 1 high by 1 wide).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYCAL</b>, a flavor of CALCOMP as implemented at the University of
          Pittsburgh, producing a plotfile which may then be output
          on a plotter.  (Nominally 11 high by 8.5 wide).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYCGM</b>, CGM output, (Computer Graphics Metafile), as implemented
          in the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's DRAWCGM package.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYIBM</b>, interactive IBM graphics (200 high, 640 wide)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYMAC</b>, Apple Macintosh graphics.  Requires TOOLBX.PAR file.
          (342 high, 512 wide).  FORTRAN can't seem to access the
          entire screen, however.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYNCR</b>, NCAR GKS graphics output to a CGM metafile.  'Meta-screen'
          is 1 high, 1 wide, but output size depends on output
          device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYNUL</b>, a null device.  This allowed you to compile a program
          with graphics calls, but without supplying any graphics library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYP10</b>, output to interactive PLOT10 graphics (768 high, 1024 wide)
          A local modification to the package allows the program
          to open a PLOT10 file in which a copy of the graphics
          may be stored, to be viewed later by typing it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYPS</b>, output to a PostScript file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ANYTTY</b>, output to a crude terminal plotting package, which uses '*' and
          blank to produce a plot.  (24 pixels high, 80 wide).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      The NUL Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>NUL</b> interface was the easiest to design.  The idea
      was that the <b>NUL</b> device was a fake device that did nothing,
      and the interface was a dummy routine with the right name that would
      keep the compiler happy.  The purpose of the <b>NUL</b> device was to
      allow me to compile and load a graphics program when I didn't actually
      want any graphics.  So the program could merrily call the ANYPLT
      routine all it wanted, but the graphics information was never sent anywhere.
    </p>

      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The BUG Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>BUG</b> interface was the second easiest to design.  The idea
      was that the <b>BUG</b> device was a fake device that simply recorded
      all the calls to the graphics interface routine by writing the data to
      a file.  This would allow me to debug a malfunctioning program by
      intercepting the graphics calls.
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "anybug.f90">anybug.f90</a>,

          the <b>BUG</b> file.

      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The CGM Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>CGM</b> interface was designed to interact with the <b>DRAWCGM</b>
      package, a graphics package developed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
      which could output graphics in CGM format, but also in PostScript or X Windows
      as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "anycgm.f90">anycgm.f90</a>,
          the source code for the interface.

          commands to compile and run the test code with the <b>CGM</b> interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "anycgm_prb_output.txt">anycgm_prb_output.txt</a>,
          the output file.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The MAC Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>MAC</b> interface was designed to interact with (a very early model)
      of the Macintosh computer, using the Absoft Fortran compiler, and an
      assembly language package called TOOLBOX.SUB, which I couldn't find if I
      wanted to now.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "anymac.f90">anymac.f90</a>,

        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      The PS Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>PS</b> interface was designed to output a PostScript image.
    </p>

    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>TTY</b> interface was designed to output ridiculously crude
      "teletype" or "typewrite" graphics.
