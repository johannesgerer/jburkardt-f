      VANDERMONDE_INTERP_2D <br> Data Interpolation with Polynomials using the Vandermonde Matrix
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>VANDERMONDE_INTERP_2D</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      finds P(X,Y), a polynomial interpolant to data Z(X,Y) which depends on two independent
      variables X and Y, by setting up and solving a linear system 
      involving the Vandermonde matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      This software is primarily intended as an illustration of the problems
      that can occur when the interpolation problem is naively formulated
      using the Vandermonde matrix.  Unless the data points are well separated,
      and the degree of the polynomial is low, the linear system will become
      very difficult to store and solve accurately, because the monomials
      used as basis vectors by the Vandermonde approach become indistinguishable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the data is available on a product grid, then both the LAGRANGE_INTERP_2D
      and VANDERMONDE_INTERP_2D libraries will be trying to compute the same
      interpolating function.  However, especially for higher degree polynomials,
      the Lagrange approach will be superior because it avoids the badly conditioned
      Vandermonde matrix associated with the usage of monomials as the basis.
      The Lagrange approach uses as a basis a set of Lagrange basis polynomials
      l(i,j)(x) which are 1 at node (x(i),y(j)) and zero at the other nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>VANDERMONDE_INTERP_2D</b> needs access to the QR_SOLVE and R8LIB libraries.
      The test code also needs access to the TEST_INTERP_2D library.
