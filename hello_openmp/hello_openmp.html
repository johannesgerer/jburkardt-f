    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HELLO_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which
      illustrates the use of the OpenMP application program interface
      within a simple "Hello, world!" program.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is so trivial that there is no point in checking its
      parallel performance.  What it is useful for is checking that the
      compiler works properly and that the OpenMP environment is set up
      correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program prints "Hello" from a nonparallel region, and then
      from a parallel region.  The number of "Hello's" produced is
      an indication of how many threads of execution have been set up.
