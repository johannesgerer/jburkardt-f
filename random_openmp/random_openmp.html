    <p>
      <b>RANDOM_NUMBER_CONTENTION</b> is a program which demontrates the possibility
      that a program calling <b>random_number</b> can run MORE SLOWLY when parallel 
      threads are added.  The performance degradation is presumed to be caused by
      contention among the threads for access to the internal saved variables that
      control the state of the random number generator.
