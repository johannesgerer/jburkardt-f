      FEM_BASIS <br> Finite Element Basis Functions <br> on an M-dimensional Simplex
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM_BASIS</b>
      is a FORTRAN90 library which
      can evaluate basis functions associated with an M-dimensional simplex
      (a 1D interval, a 2D triangle, a 3D tetrahedron, and the higher-dimensional
      generalizations).
    </p>

    <p>
      A complete polynomial space is generated, up to the user-specified degree.
      Thus, for instance, in 2D, simply by specifying the degree, the user can 
      request a space of:
      <pre>
        degree 0,  1 function,  1;
        degree 1,  3 functions, 1, x, y;
        degree 2,  6 functions, 1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2;
        degree 3, 10 functions, 1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3
      </pre>
      and so on.  Corresponding families of basis functions in higher dimensions
      are generated by specifying the degree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The feature of this library is to generate a Lagrange form of the basis
      set of the given degree, and to evaluate those basis functions at any
      point.

      The Triangular Case:
    </h3>

    <p>
      We will discuss the triangular case in detail; it is general enough
      to show all the details of the procedure, while still being simple
      enough to describe in pictures and tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the maximum degree D for the polynomial basis defined
      on a reference triangle, we have ( ( D + 1 ) * ( D + 2 ) ) / 2 monomials
      of degree at most D.  Normally, the reference triangle is supplied
      with barycentric coordinates (xsi1,xsi2,xsi3) which are nonnegative
      and add to 1.  For our purposes, we will use barycentric coordinates
      that have been multiplied by D.  This means that all the coordinates
      we are interested in will be integers, which we will now identify by
      (I,J,K) = D * (xsi1,xsi2,xsi3).  We can then define a grid of integer
      coordinates so that 0 <= I, J, K <= D and I+J+K = D, with
      (I,J,K) corresponding to 
      <ul>
        <li>
          the basis point (X,Y)(I,J,K) = ( I/D, J/D );
        </li>
        <li>
          the basis monomial P(I,J,K)(X,Y) = X^I Y^J.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, with D = 2, we have simply:
      <pre>
        F
        |\
        C-E
        |\|\
        A-B-D
      </pre>
      with 
      <pre>
         I J K    X    Y    P(I,J,K)(X,Y) 
 
      A (0 0 2) (0.0, 0.0)  1
      B (1 0 1) (0.5, 0.0)  x
      C (0 1 1) (0.0, 0.5)  y
      D (2 0 0) (1.0, 0.0)  x^2
      E (1 1 0) (0.5, 0.5)  x y
      F (0 2 0) (0.0, 1.0)  y^2
      </pre>
      Note that in this arrangement, there is an obvious relationship between
      a particular choice of (I,J,K) and the corresponding point (X,Y), as well
      as a relationship between (I,J,K) and the polynomial P(I,J,K)(X,Y).  However,
      there is no obvious connection between the point (X,Y) and the polynomial
      P(I,J,K)(X,Y).  This will change when we move to the Lagrange basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of the monomials P(I,J,K)(X,Y), we want a set of
      polynomials L(I,J,K)(X,Y) which span the same space, but have
      the Lagrange property, namely L(I,J,K)(X,Y) is 1 if (X,Y) is
      equal to (X,Y)(I,J,K), and 0 if (X,Y) is equal to any other 
      of the basis points.  One effect of this change is to tie each basis point
      (X,Y) to a particular basis polynomial L(I,J,K)(X,Y), namely, the polynomial
      which is 1 there.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is easily arranged.  Given an index (I,J,K), we compute a polynomial
      that has:
      <ol>
        <li>
          I factors of the form (X-0)   * (X-1/D)   * ... * (X-(I-1)/D);
        </li>
        <li>
          J factors of the form (Y-0)   * (Y-1/D)   * ... * (Y-(J-1)/D);
        </li>
        <li>
          K factors of the form (X+Y-(D-0)/D) * (X+Y-(D-1)/D) * ... * (X+Y-(D-(K-1))/D).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      This polynomial is the product of I+J+K linear factors, in other words,
      it is a polynomial of degree D.  This polynomial is 0 at all basis points
      except (X,Y)(I,J,K).  If we divide this polynomial by its value at
      the basis point, we arrive at the desired Lagrange polynomial
      L(I,J,K)(X,Y).  
    </p>

    <p>
      This method is applicable for a basis set of any polynomial degree;
      moreover, it is a straightforward matter to extend it to higher dimensions.

      The Triangular Prism:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A (right) <i>triangular prism</i> is a 3D shape which can be formed 
      by drawing a triangle in the XY plane and then "lifting" the triangle
      along a line in the Z direction a fixed distance.  
    </p>

    <p>
      A finite element basis family can be defined for this shape, using
      the product of basis functions in the XY triangle and basis functions
      for the Z line.  The basis functions are then defined by scaled
      barycentric coordinates I(1), I(2), I(3) for the triangle, and
      an independent set of scaled barycentric coordinates J(1) and J(2)
      for the line.  A function is provided to evaluate basis functions
      for such an element.
