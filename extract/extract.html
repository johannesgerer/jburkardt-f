      EXTRACT <br> Painless Module Extraction
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>EXTRACT</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 program which 
      pulls a copy of a FORTRAN 
      block data, function, module, program or subroutine from a big file, 
      and saves the copy in a little file.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I've found <b>EXTRACT</b> extremely useful, 
      as an alternative to printing out a huge library of routines, or using 
      an editor to extract the seven routines I need from a collection of 200.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>extract</b> <i>module</i> <i>file.f</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>module</i> is the name of the desired module;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>file.f</i> is the file to be searched.
        </li>
      </ul>
      If the module is found, it is written to a file named <i>module.f</i>.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.

      F77_CLEANUP</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes a copy of a FORTRAN77 file in which some minor cleanups have
      been made.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN file using FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
      and makes a copy that uses FORTRAN90 continuation instead.

      <a href = "../../f_src/f90split/f90split.html">
      F90SPLIT</a>,

      reads a FORTRAN file and creates individual files for every
      subroutine or function in the file.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../cpp_src/htmlindex/htmlindex.html">
      HTMLINDEX</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a FORTRAN program and writes a skeleton HTML page describing it,
      assuming that each subroutine includes a '!!' or 'cc' description line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/include_files/include_files.html">
      INCLUDE_FILES</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN program with INCLUDE statements, and makes a copy
      with the indicated files included.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/module_mark/module_mark.html">
      MODULE_MARK</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      replaces bare "END" statements by "END (module name)" statements
      in a FORTRAN90 file.
